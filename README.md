This app presents an html table showing the class meeting dates for a specified time frame and automatically fills in when those dates fall on hoidays. The program is run on Docker-Compose and outputs a document to the user-configured location. Calends currently supports SUU and TXST Academic Calendars.

# Quickstart

# Output

Calends creates a table in html and presents it filling in class dates and holidays. You can easily highlight and copy/paste into your favorite document writing program.
